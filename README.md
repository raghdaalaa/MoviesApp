# Built With
- **Kotlin** --> Official programming language for Android development.
- **Coroutines** -->  Concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- **Android Architecture Components** 
  - **LiveData** --> is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable,
       LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components.
  - **ViewModel** --> Is a class designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
  - **Android Jetpack Navigation component** --> Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, 
       and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
- **Material Components for Android** --> Customize Material Design UI components for Android.
- **Retrofit Library** --> Retrofit library to connect to a REST web service on the internet and get a response.
- **YouTube Player** --> The YouTube Player API enables you to incorporate video playback functionality into your Android application.
- **KenBurns View library** --> provides an extension to ImageView that creates an immersive experience
     by animating its drawable using the Ken Burns Effect
- **ViewBinding** --> view binding replaces findViewById
- **Paging 3** --> Pagination with Recyclerview allows the user to see the latest content as page by page. 
     As we load the next ‘page’ by the time users scroll to the bottom, more content is loaded and available
- **Room Database** --> Store data locally
# Architecture 
This app uses **MVVM (Model View View-Model)** architecture.
